<div><p>A great way to get introduced to AngularJS is to work through this tutorial, which walks you through
the construction of an AngularJS web app. The app you will build is a catalog that displays a list
of Android devices, lets you filter the list to see only devices that interest you, and then view
details for any device.</p>

<p>Work through the tutorial to see how Angular makes browsers smarter â€” without the use of extensions
or plug-ins. As you work through the tutorial, you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>See examples of how to use client-side data binding and dependency injection to build dynamic
views of data that change immediately in response to user actions.</li>
<li>See how Angular creates listeners on your data without the need for DOM manipulation.</li>
<li>Learn a better, easier way to test your web apps.</li>
<li>Learn how to use Angular services to make common web tasks, such as getting data into your app,
easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>And all of this works in any browser without modification to the browser!</p>

<p>When you finish the tutorial you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a dynamic application that works in any browser.</li>
<li>Define the differences between Angular and common JavaScript frameworks.</li>
<li>Understand how data binding works in AngularJS.</li>
<li>Use the angular-seed project to quickly boot-strap your own projects.</li>
<li>Create and run tests.</li>
<li>Identify resources for learning more about AngularJS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tutorial guides you through the entire process of building a simple application, including
writing and running unit and end-to-end tests. Experiments at the end of each step provide
suggestions for you to learn more about AngularJS and the application you are building.</p>

<p>You can go through the whole tutorial in a couple of hours or you may want to spend a pleasant day
really digging into it. If you're looking for a shorter introduction to AngularJS, check out the
