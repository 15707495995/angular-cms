<div class="description"><div class="nganimate-animate-page"><p>The <code>$animate</code> service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.</p>
<p>The <code>$animate</code> service is used behind the scenes with pre-existing directives and animation with these directives
will work out of the box without any extra configuration.</p>
<p>Requires the <a href="#/api/ngAnimate"><code>ngAnimate</code></a> module to be installed.</p>
<p>Please visit the <a href="#/api/ngAnimate"><code>ngAnimate</code></a> module overview page learn more about how to use animations in your application.</p>
