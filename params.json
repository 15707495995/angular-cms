{"name":"Angular-cms","tagline":"A light weight CMS built with Angular.js and Yeoman.","body":"# Angular CMS \r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonniespratley/angular-cms.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jonniespratley/angular-cms)\r\n\r\nThis is a lightweight CMS built with Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Node.js.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this CMS is for many reasons, the most important reason is this is the CMS that the Learning Yeoman book is going to revolve around.\r\nThe book is going to be published during the 1st quarter of the new year by Packt Publishing. Each piece has to do with a corresponding chapter in the book that I am writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n\r\n### Database\r\nThe database of choice is Mongo, its fast, easy and scalable.\r\n\r\n### Server\r\nThe server of choice is Node, its JavaScript, its fast and scalable.\r\n\r\n### AngularJS \r\nThe client-side framework of choice is Angular, its a full-stack, just what we need.\r\n\r\n### Responsive\r\nThe client-side ui of choice is Twitter Bootstrap, its updated and clean.\r\n\r\n### HTML5\r\nUsing HTML5 in every way to make a better user experience.\r\n\r\n### Customizable\r\nUsing a modular approach you can easily extend the core to your application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_(Coming soon)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Server\r\nThe server is a Node.js server that supports dynamic RESTful API calls to resource endpoints.\r\n\r\nBase URL: `http://localhost:8181/api/v2`\r\n\r\n\r\nHTTP  | METHOD | ENDPOINT\r\n------------ | ------------- | ------------\r\n GET   |   findAll     |   /database/table\r\n GET   |   findById    |   /database/table/:id\r\n POST  |   add         |   /database/table\r\n PUT   |   update      |   /database/table/:id\r\n DELETE |  destroy     |   /database/table/:id\r\n\r\n### Socket Server\r\nThis is a socket server implementation for \"real\" time analytics and other data.\r\nThis is for use with geo analytics and other backend data from the app. listen for connected clients\r\n\r\n### Socket Server Channels\r\nThese are the events that this socket server dispatches.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. cms:authorization\r\n2. cms:client:message\r\n3. cms:client:connect\r\n4. cms:client:disconnect\r\n5. cms:server:message\r\n6. cms:server:disconnect\r\n7. cms:server:connect\r\n8. cms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Must Have\r\n* user management & user roles\r\n* action and view permissions\r\n* content versioning and audit\r\n* some form of workflow and notifications\r\n* i18n support on literals and object versions\r\n* normalized database schema design\r\n* some form of content import-export\r\n* assets management and thumbnail generation for uploads\r\n* Valid XHTML (compressed with GZIP)\r\n* Rich text editing (e.g FCKeditor) which generates accessible markup\r\n* Valid and minified CSS and javascript (e.g using YUI)\r\n* automatically generated sitemaps.org document\r\n* integration with Google Analytics\r\n* automatic RSS feeds\r\n* open search support\r\n* print css and/or print versions of content\r\n* SEO consideration for duplicate content (e.g use of canonical tag)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nDownload the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].\r\n\r\n\r\n### Start the server\r\nTo start the node server you should start the mongo instance first. \r\n\r\nTo start mongodb execute the following command:\r\n\r\n\t$ sudo sh ./bin/db.sh\r\n\t\r\nTo start node execute the following command:\r\n\r\n\t$ node server\r\n\t\r\nOpen up the default host localhost:8181\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_(Coming soon)_\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n_(Coming soon)_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Themes\r\nThemes will be installed via bower, we will have a ui for searching and installing angular-cms themes searching by tag angular-cms.\r\n\r\n##### Theme Structure\r\nThis is the structure of the themes.\r\n\r\n\tmy-theme/\r\n\t\tpackage.json\r\n\t\tbower.json\r\n\t\tcss/\r\n\t\t\tmy-theme.css\r\n\t\tjs/\r\n\t\t\tmy-theme.js\r\n\t\tindex.html\r\n\t\tpartials/\r\n\t\t\theader.html\r\n\t\t\tsidebar.html\r\n\t\t\tfooter.html\r\n\t\t\tcontent.html\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Plugins\r\nPlugins will be installed via bower as well, keywords angular-cms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n_(Coming soon)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\n## Important notes\r\nPlease don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!\r\n\r\n### Code style\r\nRegarding code style like indentation and whitespace, **follow the conventions you see used in the source already.**\r\n\r\n### PhantomJS\r\nWhile Grunt can run the included unit tests via [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.\r\n\r\n## Modifying the code\r\nFirst, ensure that you have the latest [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed.\r\n\r\nTest that Grunt's CLI and Bower are installed by running `grunt --version` and `bower --version`.  If the commands aren't found, run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.  For more information about installing the tools, see the [getting started with Grunt guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) or [bower.io](http://bower.io/) respectively.\r\n\r\n1. Fork and clone the repo.\r\n1. Run `npm install` to install all build dependencies (including Grunt).\r\n1. Run `bower install` to install the front-end dependencies.\r\n1. Run `grunt` to grunt this project.\r\n\r\nAssuming that you don't see any red, you're ready to go. Just be sure to run `grunt` after making any changes, to ensure that nothing is broken.\r\n\r\n## Submitting pull requests\r\n\r\n1. Create a new branch, please don't work in your `master` branch directly.\r\n1. Add failing tests for the change you want to make. Run `grunt` to see the tests fail.\r\n1. Fix stuff.\r\n1. Run `grunt` to see if the tests pass. Repeat steps 2-4 until done.\r\n1. Open `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in actual browser to ensure tests pass everywhere.\r\n1. Update the documentation to reflect any changes.\r\n1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
